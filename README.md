### Profile

I am a software developer, architect, technical lead, author, and teacher with over 15 years of professional experience. I have been programming and building software since the age of 10, making it 30 years of overall experience in the field.

Throughout my career, I worked on software products for different businesses and in organizations of varying sizes. I started as an individual contributor in projects both for backend and frontend and quickly progressed into working as a technical lead, mentor and architect.

Since many years, I consider myself an expert in Message-Driven Systems, Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. On top of that, I am experienced in modeling techniques such as Event Storming, Domain Storytelling, and Context Mapping.

### Book

I am the author of "Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing". This book explains and illustrates how to implement Domain-Driven Design, Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing. The goal is to build software that is behavior-rich, event-based, problem-centric, reactive, scalable and well-designed.
